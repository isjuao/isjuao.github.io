Welcome to my Github page - if you've made it here, it's likely you know that **coding** plays a significant role in 
my professional life. Spot on! If I haven't lost you there already, let me give you a brief overview on what I'm 
working on right now and how I got here. 

Currently, I'm working as a Data Analyst Programmer for a team at the University of Edinburgh, after completing my
**Master of Science** program in 
[Health Data Science](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/1230/health-data-science/) 
at the University of Aberdeen. I'm passionate about using Data Science for the social good, particularly within the ðŸ§¬
biomedical domain. 

### Here's a glimpse of my coding journey ðŸ’»

- ~~It started with watching YouTube videos about sorting algorithms and neural networks~~
- It started with small **Java** scripts during my undergraduate studies in 
[Bioinformatics](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/bioinformatics-master-of-science-msc).
These focused on
[algorithmic approaches in bioinformatics](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/ss2021/vlg_algo_1/index.html) and handling
[Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) RNA-seq data](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/ws2022/prk_gobi/index.html#) (see 
  respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/tum-java-binfo)).
- During my second and third semester, I had the great 
opportunity to learn **Python** while gaining first experiences with a supervised machine learning 
  workflow by studying [signal peptides](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01156-3) and developing a model to predict 
  those from the amino acid sequence (see respective 
  [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/signal-peptide-prediction)).
- Later, I was able to strengthen my skills through a seminar project on
predicting [binding residues](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03431-4) using 
  embeddings pre-learned through protein language models (see respective
[repository](https://github.com/isjuao/binding-residue-prediction)).
- In the scope of a voluntary internship with the PSPH in Munich, I got to explore a different perspective of the buzzing
field of ML and artificial intelligence through exploring gender bias in health-related AI.
- Within my bachelor's thesis, I analysed [full-proteome predictions](https://predictprotein.org/) for a multitude of 
  protein features. This included the creation of various visualisations and their automatic creation for several 
  multi-organism comparisons. I additionally worked on making them accessible via a web-application, which I refined 
  as a student research assistant (see respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/ppprint)).
- I explored **R** for data analysis projects during my postgraduate degree and expanded my supervised 
  ML experience to the R language (see respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/uoa-r)).
- Further coursework allowed me to analyse geospatial and time series COVID-19 data of the G7 countries, 
  specifically the United States, using the Wolfram Language
(**Mathematica**) (see [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/uoa-mathematica)).
- For my Masters research project, I am working on a ML-focused project that involves me 
  setting up a deep learning model using the [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut)
and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Python libraries. The project aimed to explore the potential benefits of 
  cross-species transfer learning from macaque monkeys. It investigated if transfer learning could prove beneficial in 
  quantifying human movement patterns from regular video data, in order to ultimately improve movement pathology 
diagnosis and monitoring. I got to expand my hands-on experience with ML tools, and the code is available in
[the repository](https://github.com/isjuao/pommes).
- Within the scope of a hack weekend I attended, I worked on developing a prototype web application for a 
  platform that enables the public and healthcare enthusiasts to explore and analyse
[Scotland's prescribing data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/prescriptions-in-the-community). I am hoping to be 
  part of taking this project further in the future! Currently, the project code is available through the OpenData Scotland Github ([see repository](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/open_prescribing_scotland)).
- After part-time job search, part-time training and working as a Barista, I am excited to now be working as Data Analyst
Programmer for an amazing working group at the University of Edinburgh. More details to come ðŸ˜Š
