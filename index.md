Hi! My name is Isabell, but most people call me Isi [Àà…™ziÀê].

Welcome to my Github page! If you've made it here, it's likely you know that **coding** plays a significant role in 
my professional life - spot on! If I haven't lost you there already, let me give you a brief overview on what I'm 
working on right now and how I got here. 

Currently, I'm in the process of completing my final 
research project within my **Master of Science** program in 
[Health Data Science](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/study/postgraduate-taught/degree-programmes/1230/health-data-science/) 
at the University of Aberdeen. I'm passionate about all things Data Science, particularly within the üß¨
biomedical domain. 

Over the past few years, I have been involved in various projects centered around ü§ñ machine learning (ML) and üß† 
artificial intelligence (AI). This included developing own models, analysing predictions generated by existing 
tools, working with pre-trained deep learning models, and exploring gender bias in health-related AI.

### Here's a glimpse of my coding journey üíª

- ~~It started with watching YouTube videos about sorting algorithms and neural networks~~
- It started with small **Java** scripts during my undergraduate studies in 
[Bioinformatics](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/bioinformatics-master-of-science-msc).
These focused on
[algorithmic approaches in bioinformatics](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/ss2021/vlg_algo_1/index.html) and handling
[Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS) RNA-seq data](https://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/studium/ws2022/prk_gobi/index.html#) (see 
  respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/tum-java-binfo)).
- During my second and third semesters, I had the great 
opportunity to learn **Python** while already gaining first experiences with a supervised ML 
  workflow by studying [signal peptides](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01156-3) and developing a model to predict 
  those from the amino acid sequence (see respective 
  [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/signal-peptide-prediction)).
- Later, I was able to strengthen my skills through a seminar project on
predicting [binding residues](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03431-4) using 
  embeddings pre-learned through protein language models (see respective
[repository](https://github.com/isjuao/binding-residue-prediction)).
- Within my bachelor's thesis, I analysed [full-proteome predictions](https://predictprotein.org/) for a multitude of 
  protein features. This included the creation of various visualisations and their automatic creation for several 
  multi-organism comparisons. I additionally worked on making them accessible via a web-application, which I refined 
  as a student research assistant (see respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/ppprint)).
- I explored **R** for data analysis projects during my postgraduate degree and expanded my supervised 
  ML experience to the R language (see respective [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/uoa-r)).
- Further coursework allowed me to analyse geospatial and time series COVID-19 data of the G7 countries, 
  specifically the United States, using the Wolfram Language
(**Mathematica**) (see [repository](https://github.com/isjuao/uoa-mathematica)).
- As mentioned in the above, I'm currently working on a ML-focused research project that involves me 
  setting up a deep learning model using the [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut)
and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Python libraries. The project aims to explore the potential benefits of 
  cross-species transfer learning from macaque monkeys. It investigates if transfer learning could prove beneficial in 
  quantifying human movement patterns from regular video data, in order to ultimately improve movement pathology 
diagnosis and monitoring. I am excited to be able to expand my hands-on experience 
  with ML tools, and the project code will be made public upon completion.
- Within the scope of a recent hack weekend I attended, I worked on developing a prototype web application for a 
  platform that enables the public and healthcare enthusiasts to explore and analyse
[Scotland's prescribing data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/prescriptions-in-the-community). I am hoping to be 
  part of taking this project further in the future!
